## About

All mainstream desktop computing environments[^1] have settled on the stacking
window metaphor. However, on open source desktops there's a [large number of
alternate window managers][window-managers] that lay out windows differently
and afford the user more control.

Often computing professionals using a mainstream environment will resort to
extensions and window management applications to work around the limitations of
this model. For example [Spectacle for Mac OS][Spectacle], or [gTile for
GNOME][gTile]. These can help but tend to require the user still manage the
positioning and layout of windows or, because they are fighting against the
natural metaphor for the desktop never quite work right.

Using a non-mainstream desktop environment opens up a wide variety of
customisation but this brings with it the responsibility of building the
rest of the environment yourself. Some revel in this, while others, like myself
would like something that combines the just works nature of a full desktop
environment with the control of a window manager environment.

This website is about researching what the best of both worlds might look like
and how it might be built. As I look at different aspects and possibilities I
will write about them here. Get started by reading [A Tiling Desktop
Environment][pro-desktop]. Then check out the [subsequent posts][posts].
