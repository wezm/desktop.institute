Welcome to Desktop Institute. Since posting [A Tiling Desktop Environment] I've
been going over the comments, trying suggestions, researching existing window
managers and their code bases, and decided it would be fun to publish this
information as I collected it. That's what this site is for. The name of the
site and domain mostly came about because it was available, amusing, and cheap.
Read on for what I want to do with the site.

As a software developer I find myself wanting to rebuild everything. In theory
I have the skill. In practice I don't have the time &mdash; even though I work a
4 day week so as to dedicate a day to side projects. The most recent thing
I want to rebuild is the desktop shell. Specifically I'd like something with
the, "it just works", nature of GNOME or Mac OS, with the tiling layouts and
keyboard affordances of [Awesome].

Being a developer it's not uncommon to want to immediately leap into writing
code to scratch the itch of the day. Given time constraints and an
acknowledgement that many have come before me, [A Tiling Desktop Environment]
was my first attempt to defer writing any code and instead gather feedback and
put the idea out there.

This website is the continuation of this process. I'd like to continue researching
what's out there, how it works, how easy it is to change, and so on. Eventually I
expect one of the following outcomes:

* I find a solution that meets all the requirements.
* I tweak an existing environment to do what I want.
* I leverage some existing code to build a new desktop environment.
* I lose interest and just stick with Awesome.

The roadmap for topics I'd like to cover is below. I'll add to, and update this
roadmap as I go.

* Document a baseline for what subsequent reviews will be measured against
  * Desired features
  * My biases and preferences
* Review comments and suggestions on, A Tiling Desktop Environment
  * Sway
  * KDE + tiling scripts such as Kröhnkite
  * KDE + alternate window manager
  * GNOME with PaperWM extension
  * Xfce + alternate window manager
* A visual tour of graphical shells for inspiration
* Explore what it would take to alter existing environments
  * Review of code size, architectural choices, sources and rate of bugs
* Review the state of Wayland window compositors
* And more…
